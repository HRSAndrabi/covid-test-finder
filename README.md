# COVID-19 visualisation tool

An interactive visualisation of coronavirus (COVID-19) testing sites in Victoria. Built and maintained by [@hrs_andrabi](https://twitter.com/hrs_andrabi). Contact me at hassan@covidvictoria.com.

## Data

Data is sourced directly from the Department of Health [COVID-19 testing sites](https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/where-get-tested-covid-19), and updated at their discretion.

## Why is it broken?

This will happen everytime the Department of Health changes the structure of the input datafile. You can try and fix it via a PR, or raise an issue and I will fix it as soon as I can.

## Support
